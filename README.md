# Detection of Products in a Shelf

## Purpose of the Project
This is my capstone project for a data science bootcamp (The Data Incubator). It detects two different products and four different design features of a shelf. I confine myself to two products and four design features because I annotate the data myself. The project is easily scalable.

## Description
The project follows the TensorFlow Object Detection API Tutorial. The GitHub repository does not include the images and labelling. To train the model on a different set of images, include them in the images folder and annotate them as explained in the TensorFlow tutorial.

The Jupyter notebook data_exploration.ipynb provides a feel for how the data looks like. It uses functions defined in object_detection.py. The notebook main.ipynb trains the model using the TensorFlow folder.
