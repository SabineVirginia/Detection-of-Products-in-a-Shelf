# Detection of Products in a Shelf

## Purpose of the Project
This is my capstone project for a data science bootcamp (The Data Incubator). It detects two different products in a shelf. I confine myself to two products because I annotate the data myself. The project is easily scalable.

## Description
The project follows the TensorFlow Object Detection API Tutorial. The GitHub repository does not include the images and labelling. To train the model on a different set of images, include them in the images folder and annotate them as explained in the TensorFlow tutorial.
